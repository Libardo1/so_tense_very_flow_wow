# TensorFlow from the Plumbing Up

The TensorFlow project might be bigger than you realize. It's a
library for deep learning, yes. That affiliation, and its connection
to Google, has helped TensorFlow attract a lot of attention. But
TensorFlow is more than "just" deep learning. The core library is
suited to a broad family of machine learning methods, and exposes a
lot of the details. This provides tons of flexibility, but forces
encounters with more details than you might be expecting. Then, the
execution model is unfamiliar to those coming from, for example,
Python's scikit-learn, or most tools in R. And in addition to the core
machine learning functionality, TensorFlow also includes its own
logging system, its own interactive log visualizer (TensorBoard), and
even its own heavily engineered serving architecture. Especially for
someone hoping to explore machine learning for the first time with
TensorFlow, it can be a lot to take in.
